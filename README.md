## To do:



1. Automobile Lookup
    - Class automobile: public Set<Feature> getFeatures()
2. Feature Search
    - Supposedly the mega raid boss.
3. "Any collection that is not mandatory should be initialized as empty in the constructor; not left to be null."
   - Go through constructors and make sure this is true.
4. Put menu in a while loop so it doesnt end after a selection.

## Dont Forget:
The first time you run this, make sure you have the persistence.xml set to create tables. After the tables are created, you can comment it out.
    `            <!-- <property name="jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.database.action" value="drop-and-create" /> -->
    `
